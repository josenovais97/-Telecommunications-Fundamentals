Image Transmission Simulation with Hamming Code (7,4)
Image Transmission Simulation implements a full pipeline for sending images over a noisy channel using the Hamming (7,4) code. It reads an input image, encodes its bits with parity, simulates random bit-flip errors at a user-specified rate, decodes and corrects errors, and displays both the uncorrected and corrected results for visual comparison.
